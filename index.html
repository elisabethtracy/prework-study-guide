          <li>The [body] element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The [id] attribute is read as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
          <li>The [h] elements are used to create headings.</li>
          <li>The [ul] element represents an unordered list of items.</li>
          <li>The [ol] element represents an ordered list of items.</li>
          <li>The [li] element represents the list of items.</li>
          <li>The declaration [!DOCTYPE ...] tells the browser what document type to expect when it is opened.</li>

          <li>The [link] element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The [meta] element defines metadata such as the character set (charset, sets our character encoding), description, keywords, author, and viewport (sets the default view for our webpage).</li>
          <li>The [script] element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A content indicates the area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like width, height, block-size, etc.</li>
          <li>A border wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, the file must be linked using a [link] element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>A CSS rule has the following anatomy: selector {property: value; property: value;}</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply; separate multiple selectors by commas.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain both the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page, use the special wild card selector *.</li>
          <li>A period preceding a selector designates it as a class selector and applies these CSS property assignments to any HTML elements assigned to the class.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values; declare a variable with the [var] keyword followed by the name you assign to the variable.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>Variable = value gives the previously (or in the same line) declared variable a value.</li>
          <li>A string value (a sequence of text) is enclosed in single or double quotation marks.</li>
          <li>A number value does not have quotes around it.</li>
          <li>A Boolean value (true/false) does not have quotes around it.</li>
          <li>An array value is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference; var arrayname = ["string", #, true/false, ...];</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>An object value can be anything; everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored as a variable.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippits of text that can be added along with code which the browser ignores; marked with /* comment */ OR // comment.</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <li>Addition operator (+) adds two numbers together or combines two strings.</li>
          <li>Subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operators function as in basic math.</li>
          <li>Assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.</li>
          <li>Strict equality operator (===) performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type; will return a Boolean result.</li>
          <li>Not (!) and does-not (!==) equal operators return the logically opposite value of what it precedes (i.e., turns true to false and vice versa).
          <li><a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators>Click here for a full list of JavaScript operators and expressions!></a></li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not; commonly represented as if...else.</li>
          <li>The expression inside the if() is the test; if the comparison runs true, the first block of code runs.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse; typically appears like variable = value(argument).</li>
          <li>Events are code structures that listen for activity in the browser and run code in response.</li>
          <li>An anonymous function doesn't have a name; an alternative way to write them is called an arrow function, and appears () => instead of function ():.</li>
          <li>Primitive values refer to all types of values except objects that define immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language.</li>
          <li>All primitive types (except null and undefined) can be tested by the typeof operator.</li>
          <li>Conceptually, undefined indicates the absense of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object; null is a keyword, but undefined is a normal identifier that happens to be a global property.</li>
          <li>NaN is a special kind of number value that's typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number; it is also the only value in JS that is not equal to itself.</li>
          <li>BigInt type values are a numeric primitive in JS that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude (even beyond JS's safe integer limit).</li>
          <li>A BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer or by calling the BigInt() function.</li>
          <li>JavaScript strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it.</li>
          <li>A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property; their purpose is to create unique property keys that are guaranteed not to clash with keys from other code.</li>
          <li>Objects are the only mutable values in JS and can be seen as a collection of properties; either data or accessor properties which have corresponding attributes.</li>
          <li>Data properties associate a key with a value and can be described by the attributes value, writable, enumerable, or configurable.</li>
          <li>Accessor properties associate a key with one of two accessor functions (get and set) to retrieve or store a value and can be described by the attributes get, set, enumerable, or configurable.</li>
          <li>Objects include dates, indexed collections, keyed collections, structured data, and more.</li>
          <li>To open Chrome DevTools use Ctrl+Shift+I.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script; runs from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>An if statement: if (condition) { // block of code to be executed if condition is truthy }.</li>
          <li>A value is considered 'falsy' if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.<li>
          <li>A piece of data's index is used to access individual data inside an array; the first item in any array has an index of 0.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains 3 statements: var x = 0; determines the starting point for our loop. The condition allows the loop to execute 1 time for each item in the array. The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
          <li>A for loop: for (var x = 0; x < array.length; x++) { code block }.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task; they must be called by name in order to execute.</li>
          <li>To declare a function use the function keyword and name the function followed by parentheses; add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task to perform.</li></li>
